============

Look for the video tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZa5JXmsWZs) for the full instructions.

#### IAM Roles

Create two IAM roles with custom policies using the **IAM.txt** file.

#### EC2 Instance

1. When server is booted run the following commands as root.

  * `yum -y update`

  * `yum install -y aws-cli`

  *  `cd /home/ec2-user`

2. Here you will setup your AWS access, secret, and region.

  * `aws configure`

  *  `aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/latest/install . --region us-east-1`

  *  `chmod +x ./install`

3. This is simply a quick hack to get the agent running faster.

  *  `sed -i "s/sleep(.*)/sleep(10)/" install`

  *  `./install auto`

4. Verify it is running.

  * `service codedeploy-agent status`
